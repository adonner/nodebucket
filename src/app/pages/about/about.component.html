                    Twin Lab Works was founded in 2018 by a young, up-and-coming developer named Adam Donner while he was a 
                    student at Bellevue University. What started as a class project, has grown rapidly to the company that it 
                    is today.  Adam, along with a skilled group of developers at Twin Lab Works, are developing the future that 
                    they want to live and work in.

                    At Twin Lab Works we have one goal in mind, to create beautiful web applications that are both easy and 
                    intuitive. We create the web tools that promote a more organized, more fulfilling way to work and live.  
                    Not only do we have a a suite of software ready to deploy in any business environment, we also develop 
                    custom software that can be built specifically for our customer’s business needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One example of our suite of ready to deploy software is nodebucket. nodebucket is an easy to use task management 
                    application that keeps track of all of your tasks, projects, and goals in one simple, easy to use application. 
                    With a familiar drag and drop interface and easy to understand buttons, nodebucket really is an application that 
                    any user can login and begin enjoying right away!
